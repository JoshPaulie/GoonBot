**If your name is hobo and you are a username genius..**
DM a name (or multiple names, one name per line) to <@727921429571436564>

**Do not** seperate names as follows:
`Rooftop Beach, Doctor Optopus`

Each username should be on a new line, like it would be in your `tism.txt`.

If you are not hobo, your dm's will be ignored. =D
